## **üõ†Ô∏è How It Works**
Shor‚Äôs Algorithm factorizes a **semiprime number** \( N = p \times q \) by:
1. **Selecting a random coprime base \( a \)**.
2. **Finding the order \( r \)** where \( a^r \equiv 1 \mod N \) using classical methods.
3. **Computing factors using \( \gcd(a^{r/2} - 1, N) \) and \( \gcd(a^{r/2} + 1, N) \)**.
4. **Executing an optimized quantum circuit for modular exponentiation**.
5. **Visualizing results using a quantum circuit diagram and a histogram**.
